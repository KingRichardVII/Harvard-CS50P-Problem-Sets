"""
GOAL:
Python already supports math, whereby you can write code to add, subtract, multiply, or divide values and even variables. But let’s write a program that enables users to do math, even without knowing Python.

In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

x is an integer
y is +, -, *, or /
z is an integer
For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

Note that, just as python itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your interpreter.py be an interpreter for math!
